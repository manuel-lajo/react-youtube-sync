## Submission Instructions

Once you're finished with the take home assignment, please zip up your code and send it to us via email. Please include any relevant instructions in this README for how to start up the frontend and backend of the app you created.


## ðŸ’» Backend

Backend is implemented using Firestore, so it is ready and running :)

## ðŸ’» Frontend

In the project directory, install all dependencies:

### `npm install`

\
then you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## ðŸ¦‰ Improvements & Considerations

There were many code improvements and good practices that were not included given the time constraints:

- Firestore could have been handled with redux
- Better folder organization for the project
- More components to better divide functionality
- Error handling & boundaries
- Better CSS handling (CSS modules or tailwind CSS maybe)
- Responsive design
- Unit testing
- Set rules for Firestore database read/write operations
- Bonus functionality

## ðŸ’¯ Thanks!
