## 💻 Backend

Backend is implemented using Firestore, so it is ready and running :)

## 💻 Frontend

In the project directory, install all dependencies:

### `npm install`

\
then you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## 🦉 Improvements & Considerations

There were many code improvements and good practices that were not included given the time constraints:

- Firestore could have been handled with redux
- Better folder organization for the project
- More components to better divide functionality
- Error handling & boundaries
- Better CSS handling (CSS modules or tailwind CSS maybe)
- Responsive design
- Unit testing
- Set rules for Firestore database read/write operations
- Bonus functionality

## 💯 Thanks!
